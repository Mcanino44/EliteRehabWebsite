This is pretty much barebones--I left in a bunch of stuff for obvious reasons (like the navigation bar and basic
jumbotron stuff and footer information)

Give it a shot and explore with bootstrap!!

If bootstrap is being annoying, raw html css is perfectly fine to use as well!!! Please refer to 
the examples I've made for you and the documentation links I've provided!

                         but recently made NY his home. After receiving his doctorate in physical therapy from Marist College,

                         His interests include tennis and golf, distance trail running and cycling. 
                         He is passionate about always improving his hands-on manual skills and working with others
                         to optimize performance.Aside from physical activity, his interests include spending

                        athlete's, especially baseball players. Michael has several years of experience doing both personal 
                        training and nutrition coaching. He believes that health and wellness is more than just being active. He believes 
                        it involves many aspects such as nutrition, physical activity, socialization, as well as mental health. You can
                        expect a well rounded approach where you're being treated not as just a diagnosis on a prescription, but as a person.
                        His passion is helping others return to their level of functioning prior to their injury or condition or to

                        Science in Kinesiology from Cal State University of Domiguez Hills. He then went on to receive his Doctorate in 
                        Physical Therapy with high honors from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY. He has a background in manual therapy
                         and certifications in sports performance. He believes integrating a hands on approach to treatment combined with
                          corrective movements results in the highest quality of care for his patients. He spends his free time hiking the 
                          trails of Catskills, disk golfing, spending time with family, and looking for new gourmet cheeseburgers to try.</p>

                    <p class="Introduction" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Gabriela Rodriguez, P.T., D.P.T. graduated from the Marist College Doctor of Physical
                         Therapy program in 2022.  Prior to her career in Physical Therapy, Gabriela worked in what felt like an
                         unfulfilling paralegal career in NYC.  Ultimately, she decided that she wanted to change paths and 
                         focus on a more rewarding career that would provide a meaningful service to others.
                         Gabriela chose Physical Therapy because it was the clearest convergence of her interests: 
                         fitness, life-long learning and most importantly, helping others.  Working with patients 
                         and helping them meet their goals is easily her favorite part of the job. 
                         In her free time, Gabreila enjoys running, hiking and playing with her dog Bennie.</p>
