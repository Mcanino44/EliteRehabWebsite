<!--
This is pretty much barebones--I left in a bunch of stuff for obvious reasons (like the navigation bar and basic
jumbotron stuff and footer information)

Give it a shot and explore with bootstrap!!

If bootstrap is being annoying, raw html css is perfectly fine to use as well!!! Please refer to 
the examples I've made for you and the documentation links I've provided!

                    <h2>How clean is your clinic?</h2>
                    <p>Elite hashas always kept immaculate standards and nightly cleaning of its clinics. 
                       In early March 2020 when the Coronavirus pandemic began, SPEAR added an additional
                       sterilization process in its clinics, using an EPA-registered disinfectant that 
                       qualifies under the EPA’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against SARS-CoV-2,
                       a coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We also implemented patient and therapist screening,
                       as well as many more tactics you can read about here, which ensure we are well beyond 
                       the CDC’s recommended sanitization levels for a service that the Federal and State
                       governments have identified as an essential service.</p>
                    <h2>What do I need to waer for my initial appointment?</h2>
                    <p>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing and a pari of rubber-soled sneakers.
                        Every treatment course begins with a comprehensive evaluation.</p>
                    <h2>Should I bring X-rays and MRI reports with me?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, please do. Although we can request these from your doctor or lab facility
                        it is better if you provide them for us during your first visit so that we can 
                        perform a more complete and accurate evaluation.You will be asked to fill out some basic paperwork, 
                        so don’t forget to bring your prescription for physical therapy.</p>
                    <h2>What types of treatments do you perform?</h2>
                    <P>We perform various types of treatments, and will customize a program 
                        combining the best techniques specific for your particular injury. 
                        The modalities and techniques we use include soft tissue massage, 
                        joint mobilization, electrical stimulation, stretching, therapeutic 
                        exercises, and ice. The treatment program will be performed in a
                         private treatment room as well as a gym setting using a variety 
                         of athletic and rehabilitation equipment.</P>
                    <h2>What type of equipment do you have on the premises?</h2>
                    <p>Because we focus on rehabilitation as well as performance enhancement,
                         we have a full gym on the premises, including a variety of equipment
                          intended solely for rehabilitation.</p>
                    <h2>Do I always see the same therapist?</h2>
                    <p>At the SPEAR Center, you will always see the same physical therapist
                         that you start with, except for special circumstances such as 
                         scheduling difficulties or special diagnoses.</p>
                    <h2>How often will I come?</h2>
                    <p>Most treatment schedules are for 2-3 visits
                       per week, but this will vary based on your condition and physical
                       ability. Physical therapy sessions typically last an hour. </p>
